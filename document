today i learn something like how to solve when any element
is larger and out of screen size then it show yellow and black rectangel
which shows your element is out of the screen


so for solve this problem we need to use

width & height
but the problem is in width height we use specific number which
work only those screen where developer build application
if any user phone have smaller screen or bigger screen or horizontal
then it makes problem

so

i learn new widget and that is // Expanded class
this widget is very useful because it automatically allocate size of
the element according to screen

if user want to change child size than other child then use //flex
